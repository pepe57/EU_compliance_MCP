Query **50 EU regulations** — from GDPR and AI Act to DORA, Chips Act, MiFID II, eIDAS, Medical Device Regulation, MDCG cybersecurity guidance, and more — directly from Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client.

If you're building digital products, financial services, healthcare tech, or connected devices for the European market, this is your compliance reference.

Built by [Ansvar Systems](https://ansvar.eu) — Stockholm, Sweden

## Why This Exists

EU compliance is scattered across EUR-Lex PDFs, official journals, and regulatory sites. Whether you're:
- A **developer** implementing GDPR data rights or NIS2 incident reporting
- A **product team** navigating AI Act risk assessments or Medical Device conformity
- A **compliance officer** mapping ISO 27001 to DORA requirements
- A **legal researcher** comparing PSD2 authentication vs. eIDAS trust services

...you shouldn't need a law degree and 47 browser tabs. Ask Claude. Get the exact article. With context.

This MCP server makes EU regulations **searchable, cross-referenceable, and AI-readable**.

## 🎬 See It In Action

### Why This Works

**Verbatim Source Text (No LLM Processing):**
- All article text is ingested from EUR-Lex/UNECE official sources
- Snippets are returned **unchanged** from SQLite FTS5 database rows
- Zero LLM summarization or paraphrasing — the database contains regulation text, not AI interpretations
- **Note:** HTML-to-text conversion normalizes whitespace/formatting, but preserves content

**Smart Context Management:**
- Search returns **32-token snippets** with highlighted matches (safe for context)
- Article retrieval warns about token usage (some articles = 70k tokens)
- Cross-references help navigate without loading everything at once

**Technical Architecture:**
```
EUR-Lex HTML → Parse → SQLite → FTS5 snippet() → MCP response
                  ↑                    ↑
           Formatting only      Verbatim database query
```

### Example: EUR-Lex vs. This MCP

| EUR-Lex | This MCP Server |
|---------|-----------------|
| Search by CELEX number | Search by plain English: *"incident reporting timeline"* |
| Navigate 100+ page PDFs | Get the exact article with context |
| Manual cross-referencing | `compare_requirements` tool does it instantly |
| "Which regulations apply to me?" → research for days | `check_applicability` tool → answer in seconds |
| Copy-paste article text | Article + definitions + related requirements |
| Check 47 sites for updates | Daily automated freshness checks |
| No API, no integration | MCP protocol → AI-native |

**EUR-Lex example:** Download DORA PDF → Ctrl+F "incident" → Read Article 17 → Google "What's a major incident?" → Cross-reference NIS2 → Repeat for 5 regulations

**This MCP:** *"Compare incident reporting requirements across DORA, NIS2, and CRA"* → Done.

## Directory Review Notes

### Testing Account and Sample Data

This server is read-only and does not require a login account for functional review.
For directory review, use the bundled dataset and these sample prompts:
- *"What does NIS2 Article 21 require?"*
- *"Compare DORA and NIS2 incident reporting obligations."*
- *"Map ISO 27001 controls to DORA requirements."*

### Remote Authentication (OAuth 2.0)

The default server runtime is read-only and can be deployed without authentication.
If you deploy a remote authenticated endpoint, use OAuth 2.0 over TLS with certificates from recognized authorities.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

### Legal Advice

> **🚨 THIS TOOL IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE 🚨**
>
> Regulation text is sourced verbatim from EUR-Lex and UNECE (official public sources). However:
> - **Control mappings** (ISO 27001, NIST CSF) are interpretive aids, not official guidance
> - **Applicability rules** are generalizations, not legal determinations
> - **Cross-references** are research helpers, not compliance mandates
>
> **Always verify against official sources and consult qualified legal counsel for compliance decisions.**

### Token Usage

> **⚠️ Context Window Warning**
>
> Some articles are very large (e.g., MDR Article 123 = ~70,000 tokens). The MCP server:
> - **Search tool**: Returns smart snippets (safe for context)
> - **Get article tool**: Returns full text (may consume significant tokens)
> - **Recommendation**: Use search first, then fetch specific articles as needed
>
> Claude Desktop has a 200k token context window. Monitor your usage when retrieving multiple large articles.

### ISO Standards Copyright

**No copyrighted ISO standards are included.** Control mappings reference ISO 27001:2022 control IDs only (e.g., "A.5.1", "A.8.2"). The actual text of ISO standards requires a paid license from ISO. This tool helps map regulations to controls but doesn't replace the standard itself.

## Branching Strategy

This repository uses a `dev` integration branch. **Do not push directly to `main`.**

```
feature-branch → PR to dev → verify on dev → PR to main → deploy
```

- `main` is production-ready. Only receives merges from `dev` via PR.
- `dev` is the integration branch. All changes land here first.
- Feature branches are created from `dev`.
